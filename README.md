• A web application which allows users to mutually exchange books, with a centralized database and an administrator for maintenance. 
• Implemented a simple secure login/sign up system coded in Java Spring boot and directly connected with SQL database. 
• Developed and designed several API endpoints like Add Book, Delete Book, Borrow Book, Change Password, etc. 
• Developed a separate page for every user, for keeping a track of borrowed and lent books, which could be manipulated by the administrator or that user.
